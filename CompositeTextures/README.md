# Composite Textures

## TODO: Will submit code.

## Objective

There might be times where it's useful to combine multiple textures together and apply it to a Material slot in a data-driven way at runtime. Some use cases are:

* Dynamically apply texture effects.
* Equipment system, in which multiple textures are layered on top of each other and then assigned to the Character's material to apply Material-based equipment looks (e.g.: World of Warcraft).
* Applying tattoos, or sun tan marks to a Character's base skin texture.
* Combining masks together on a masked material. For example, an equipment system in which you can equip meshes over your Character mesh, and don't want the character mesh clipping through the various items.

## Usage

1. Add this component to an Actor which contains a mesh you want to generate composite textures on.
2. ...
